Data cleaning functions for Python

This file contains functions aimed at checking, and then fixing errors according to the following data quality dimensions:

Accuracy: Accuracy measures whether the data correctly reflects the real-world entities or events it is supposed to represent. Note that although records can be checked with rules (e.g. no-one can be an age under 0), this will not check for innaccuracies that still conform to these rules.

Completeness: Completeness measures whether all required data is present. Missing or incomplete data diminishes the utility of a dataset.

Uniqueness: Data should not have unnecessary duplicates.

Cleanliness/Validity: Data should conform to defined formats, rules, or standards.

Timeliness: Data should be available when needed and reflect the most up-to-date information.

Consistency: Data should be consistent across different systems or datasets, and therefore should not conflict between systems or datasets.
